# Article Images
[article-images.php](article-images.php) is a small library that extends some of the benefits of WordPress' [Post Thumbmails][1] feature to images in the content of a blog post. article-images can:

1. Evaluate whether an article contains *any* image content in the form of an `<img>` tag.
2. Agnostically evaluate whether an article contains *any* associated image, either as WordPress Post Thumbnail, or within the article content.
3. Return the first image from the content of a post, convert it to a filesystem path and return its size.
4. Agnostically return the firat image from an article, either from its content or from the WordPress thumbnail.

## S-senpai...why?
[My blog][2] was eight years old when I discovered the [Long Now Foundationn][3] through Neal Stephenson's novel [*Anathem*][4]. *Anathem* and the LNF raised questions about the *long*-term integrity and accessibility of my blog archive. In short: how able am I to move away from WordPress if I decide to do so? article-images is part of my answer to this question: It permits me to enjoy some of the benefits of WordPress without tying my media library to the CMS.

## Usage
Several functions in article-images blindly grab an image from an article without consideration as to what the image may be. Images are used in this order, if they exist:

1. The feature image of the article.
2. The first content image of the article.
3. The script's designated fallback image.

## Fallback Image
Several functions in article-images.php use a last-resort fallback image when the article has neither a featured image nor a content image. This file is [fallback.jpg](fallback.jpg), and its usage is set at the head of article-images.php

You are absolutely welcome to add and set your own fallback image in your own theme!

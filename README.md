# Article Images

[article-images.php](article-images.php) is a small library intended for use in either a WordPress theme or plugin. To give pointless exposition:

I had kept a blog for several years before I discovered the [Long Now Foundationn](http://longnow.org/) through Neal Stephenson's 2011 novel [*Anathem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem). I've committed to keeping a blog so long as I am able, and I realize that, given enough time, I will eventually move away from WordPress. To that end, I keep [my site's](http://www.bhalash.com/) media content separate from the WordPress media manager.

This convoluted circumstance required me to write an additional set of functions to treat the first image in an article's content as the article's featured image.

## Support
Your mileage will vary; while this library is suitable for my site, it's compatibility with yours is unknowable. Caveat emptor! Pull requests and forks are welcome. If you have a simple support question, email <mark@bhalash.com>. I'm happy to take on paid commissions for more advanced requests.
